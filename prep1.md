### Step 1: Planning
**Scheduled Meeting**: Our team will hold a 1-hour kickoff meeting to discuss and finalize the Team Agreement, covering each section detailed below.

### Step 3: Team Dynamics
**Strengths & Utilization**: Each team member will contribute their unique strengths, from technical expertise to project management and communication skills. We will document these strengths in our team's GitHub repo to leverage them effectively throughout the project.

**Areas for Growth & Past Stress Factors**: We recognize the importance of continuous learning and addressing past project stress factors. Each team member will identify personal areas for growth and past stressors, documented in a private section of our project repo to foster a supportive environment.

### Step 4: Conflict and Confrontation Plan
**Resolution Process**: Our team agrees to address conflicts directly and respectfully, utilizing a team meeting or Discord chat for resolution. A step-by-step conflict resolution guideline will be documented in our GitHub repo.

**Handling Disagreements & Work Distribution**: In cases of disagreement or if a team member takes over the project, we will revert to our documented resolution process and adjust responsibilities as needed to ensure equitable contribution.

**Raising Concerns & Escalation**: Concerns about project standards or contributions will be openly discussed in team meetings. If internal resolution attempts fail, concerns will be escalated to our instructor.

### Step 5: Cooperation and Scheduling Plan
**Communication Platforms**: Primary communication through GitHub for documentation and code, with Discord as our secondary communication tool for daily check-ins and updates.

**Availability & Scheduling**: Team availability will be documented in a shared Google Calendar, including time zones, to ensure overlapping work hours for collaboration.

**Remote Work Considerations**: For team members in different time zones, we will schedule key meetings at times that are convenient for all, with flexibility for asynchronous work.

### Step 6: Work Plan and Git Process
**Task Management**: Using GitHub Issues for task tracking, assignments, and progress updates. A clear labeling system will be employed for efficient management.

**Documentation and Deliverables**: All project documentation will be maintained in markdown files within our GitHub repo, ensuring clarity and version control. Image files for topology or other diagrams will be included as necessary.

**Git Workflow**: 
- **Branching Strategy**: Feature branches for development, merging into main through PRs.
- **Commit Guidelines**: Meaningful commit messages, referencing issue numbers.
- **Pull Requests and Reviews**: PRs for all changes, requiring at least one review for merge.

**Conflict Resolution in Git**: A process for handling merge conflicts, prioritizing communication and collaboration to resolve issues quickly.

### Final Considerations
Our team is committed to a collaborative, respectful, and productive project experience. By adhering to the agreed-upon guidelines and leveraging our strengths, we aim to achieve our project goals effectively and efficiently, ensuring a positive and enriching learning environment for all team members.
