### 1. Preparation and Reconnaissance

- **Understand Your Tools and Environment**: Make sure each team member is familiar with the tools and environments you'll be using. This includes proficiency in Kali Linux, Web Security Dojo, and other penetration testing tools.
- **Gather Information**: Use tools like Nmap to scan the target network (10.0.0.0/24) to identify active hosts and services, excluding the out-of-bounds systems. This initial scan helps you understand the landscape without interacting with restricted systems.

### 2. Scanning and Enumeration

- **Identify Targets**: From your initial reconnaissance, determine which systems within the network are potential targets. Focus on identifying services and open ports that could be vulnerable.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Utilize vulnerability scanners like Nessus or OpenVAS to detect known vulnerabilities on the identified targets. This will help prioritize your efforts based on the criticality of the vulnerabilities found.

### 3. Gaining Access

- **Exploitation**: Based on the vulnerabilities identified, use tools like Metasploit to craft and execute exploits against vulnerable targets. Always consider the impact and ensure you have explicit permission to exploit these vulnerabilities within the project's scope.
- **Maintaining Access**: Should you successfully exploit a system, consider how you can maintain access for further exploration and analysis. Tools like reverse shells or installing backdoors can be part of this phase but remember to stay within the ethical boundaries of your project.

### 4. Reporting and Reflection

- **Document Your Findings**: Keep detailed records of your activities, including the tools used, vulnerabilities exploited, and the outcome of each action. This documentation is crucial for your final project report.
- **Analyze and Reflect**: Discuss as a team what worked, what didn't, and how you could improve. Reflect on the ethical considerations and legal implications of each action in a real-world context.

### 5. Communication

- **Engage with Your Instructor**: Marco Vazquez, your instructor, is a valuable resource. Keep him informed of your progress, challenges, and any questions that arise. His insights can guide you through obstacles and deepen your understanding of cybersecurity practices.

### Ethical Considerations

Remember, the skills you're developing are powerful and carry significant responsibility. Always use them ethically, legally, and with permission. Your actions should aim to improve security, enhance learning, and never harm or exploit others without consent.

Good luck with your final project, Red Team! Remember, this is a fantastic opportunity to apply what you've learned in a practical setting while adhering to the principles of ethical hacking and cybersecurity.
