## Scenario
The Terminators are tasked with executing a red team operation against a designated target network (10.0.0.0/24), with the exception of specified out-of-bounds systems. The mission involves utilizing a series of tools for penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, enhancing the client's cybersecurity measures effectively.

## Systems Selection

### Kali Linux
- **Integration:** Provides a comprehensive suite of penetration testing tools crucial for assessing the security of the target network.
- **Problem Solving:** Facilitates the identification and exploitation of vulnerabilities, offering tools like Nmap for scanning and Metasploit for executing exploits.

### Nmap
- **Integration:** Key for the initial scanning phase; identifies active hosts and services within the target network.
- **Problem Solving:** Enables the pinpointing of potential entry points by discovering open ports and services, setting the stage for targeted attacks.

### Burp Suite
- **Integration:** Ideal for conducting detailed security assessments of web applications within the target network.
- **Problem Solving:** Provides both automated and manual testing capabilities to uncover web vulnerabilities, critical for a thorough security audit.

### Splunk (Understanding)
- **Integration:** Knowledge of Splunk's network monitoring capabilities is crucial for conducting stealthy operations.
- **Problem Solving:** Guides the adoption of techniques to evade detection, ensuring testing activities do not alert the client's monitoring systems.

### Web Security Dojo
- **Integration:** Offers a contained environment for practicing web penetration testing skills.
- **Problem Solving:** Acts as a sandbox for refining attack strategies against web vulnerabilities, bolstering the team's readiness and effectiveness.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition
- **Network Scan Report:** Showcasing the identification of active hosts, services, and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Exploited Vulnerabilities:** Demonstrating successful exploitation of a vulnerability, emphasizing the team's ability to gain unauthorized access or extract sensitive data.
- **Web Application Security Report:** Highlighting specific vulnerabilities found in web applications, supported by proof-of-concept exploits.
- **Stealth Tactics:** Evidence of conducting penetration tests without triggering alerts in the client's monitoring systems, leveraging insights into Splunk.

The Terminators aim to deliver a comprehensive penetration testing demonstration, underlining the ability to identify, exploit, and report key security vulnerabilities while maintaining operational stealth.
